## Hello, World!

This is my first blog post using R Markdown. Let's explore some basic R operations and create a simple graph.

### Basic R Operations

First, let's perform some simple calculations:

```{r basic-math}
2 + 2
sqrt(16)
pi
```

library(ggplot2)

# Create some dummy data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Trend Line",
       x = "X Axis",
       y = "Y Axis")
