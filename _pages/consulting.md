My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of decision-making, motivation, fatigue, and stress 
and how these processes affect our performance and mental health. I use computational and mathematical 
models to understand how these complex processes evolve and interact over time. I use this knowledge 
to help design work environments that promote happier, healthier, and more effective work. Practical 
applications of this work so far have included providing evidence-based recommendations regarding 
alternative work concepts such as the four-day work week, enhancing the capacity and safety of unmanned 
aerial systems operations, providing tools to forecast fatigue in safety critical work environments, 
and improving climate change communication practices. My research program has received over $3 million 
in funding from the Australian Research Council and industry. My work has been published in journals 
such as Psychological Review, Psychological Science, Journal of Applied Psychology, The Leadership 
Quarterly, Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, Organizational 
Research Methods, Behavior Research Methods, Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,
Journal of Neuroscience, and Global Environmental Change. 

My major scientific contributions have been in two areas:

*1. Pioneering new methods for analysing complex human data.* A major contribution of my work has been
the use of cutting-edge computational, mathematical, and statistical models for generating novel insights
from messy data. This work has led to advances in the methods we analyse change in people and processes over time and how
we assess heterogeneity across individuals and groups. Key papers are as follows:

*2. Decision-making, self-regulation, and fatigue.* My work has also improved our understanding of how people 
manage competing demands on their time, effort, and other resources, and the implications these decisions have 
on motivation, fatigue, and mental health. My team has developed computational models to simulate the way people
make task prioritisation decisions when under time pressure, how rostering and work patterns influence long-term
fatigue trajectories among shift workers in safety critical environments, and how the number of hours people work
shapes their mental health over time. Key papers are as follows:
