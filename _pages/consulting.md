Building on over a decade of academic research in decision-making, motivation, fatigue, and stress, 
I offer specialised consulting services that translate complex data into actionable insights. 
My unique value lies not only in understanding human behaviour in work environments but 
also in my expertise in advanced analytic methods. This dual focus allows me 
to provide tailored, data-driven solutions that improve workforce health, safety, and performance.

With a PhD from the University of Western Australia and nearly a decade of experience at the 
University of Queensland, my work has been at the forefront of pioneering new methods for 
analysing complex human data. As a consultant, I apply this expertise to help organisations 
leverage their data to solve complex people-related challenges.

## Why Work With Me?

What sets me apart is my unique combination of advanced data analytics expertise and deep knowledge 
of business and organisational psychology. I not only offer technical proficiency in data analysis 
and modeling, but I also bring a thorough understanding of the human and organisational factors 
that drive health, safety, and performance. This dual expertise allows me to provide insights that 
are not only cutting-edge statistically but also highly relevant to real-world organisational challenges. 
I don’t just deliver numbers—I translate complex data into actionable strategies that enhance 
decision-making, optimise workforce productivity, and promote employee well-being.

## Services I Offer 

### Predictive Workforce Analytics
I help organisations anticipate critical workforce outcomes such as employee turnover, fatigue, 
and mental health trajectories. By applying advanced statistical techniques like Bayesian modeling 
and longitudinal data analysis, I can provide more accurate predictions that allow you to proactively 
address potential issues and optimise workforce planning.

### Workplace Well-Being & Mental Health Insights
I help uncover new insights about the complex relationships between work conditions and employee well-being. 
These insights enable organisations to design work environments that reduce stress, enhance mental health, and 
boost productivity. For example, I can help you understand how work hours, job demands, and 
organisational changes impact employee health over time, providing clear, evidence-based 
recommendations to improve employee well-being.

### Fatigue Risk Management
My expertise in biomathematical fatigue modeling and Bayesian estimation of uncertainy has allowed me to develop 
tools that predict fatigue levels in safety-critical environments involving shift work, such aviation, 
mining, or defense. These tools provide actionable insights to more effectively manage fatigue-related risks and 
improve both safety and operational performance.

### Optimising organisational Design and Work Practices
Through the application of computational simulations, I assist organisations in 
optimising work environments and operational practices. I use data to model the potential impact 
of changes such as implementing a four-day work week or work role redesign. This allows 
organisations to make informed decisions that balance operational efficiency with employee well-being.

### Data Visualisation & Reporting
I deliver insights in a way that’s easy to understand and act upon. Through clear visualisations, 
interactive dashboards, or customised reports, I ensure that your organisation has the tools it 
needs to interpret and apply the data effectively.

## Recent Projects

### Fatigue Forecasting in Safety-Critical Work Environments
I developed an algorithm to predict fatigue levels in naval submarine crews, enabling more informed 
crewing decisions that ensure performance is maintained in critical situations. This algorithm was integrated 
into a software application, designed to assist with rostering of shift work in high reliability environments. 
The tool helps managers reduce the risk of fatigue-related performance issues by optimising 
shift assignments, improving both safety and operational efficiency.

### Designing Next-Generation Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems
I developed a computational model that simulates the workflow and task allocation of remotely piloted 
aircraft crews. The model provided nuanced insights into how task distribution, workload, communication 
patterns, and decision-making processes interact, revealing areas where safety risks or inefficiencies 
could occur. By understanding these interactions, the model helps identify opportunities to redesign 
workflows, improving both safety and crew efficiency.

### Mental Well-Being and Working Hours
I developed a new hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach for identifying individual differences in the long-term effects of 
working hours on mental health, enabling actionable recommendations for workforce wellbeing. This approach allows for insights
not only about average effects across a workforce, but also in the variation in effects, including the proportion of employees that
may be adversely effected by certain policies and the factors that may mitigate those adverse effects. This allowed for more 
targeted recommendations to improve workforce well-being.
