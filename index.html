I'm a senior research fellow in business and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland. I manage a large program of research
and consulting focused on applying advanced analytic methods like statistical, computational, and mathematical models to improve the health, safety, and 
performance of people at work. My research aims to understanding the dynamics of decision-making, motivation, fatigue, and stress 
and how these processes affect our performance and mental health. Building on this research, I offer services as an advanced HR and people 
anlytics consultant where I help organisations leverage their data to generate actionable strategies that enhance decision-making, 
optimise workforce productivity, and promote employee well-being.
